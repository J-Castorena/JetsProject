# JetsProject

#Description
Starting the application, the AirField will populate with 5 pre-made jets for the user to manage. A menu will be displayed with all the different functions the application is able to do. The application will offer the user the ability to view the most current list of jets. The user can also fly the jets, view the fastest jet, and view the jet with the longest range. The next couples of option will allow the users to call unique functions the jets may hold. This application will also extend the ability to create new jets and the capability to remove any jet on the list. User can then choose to quit the application.

#Technologies Used
Java, git, Interfaces, Polymorphism, Inheritance, I/O.

#Lessons Learned#
This project helped me understand the importance of Polymorphism. I can now see how inheritance and polymorphism go hand in hand. The child classes inherited methods and properties from the parent class but we were able to give them unique functions. Using the '@override' quality takes a big roll on what the system will use when the parent class and the child class hold similar methods.
